              <h1 class="sub-title">About Spider-Man</h1>
              <p>Spider-Man, created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, first appeared in Marvel Comics' "Amazing Fantasy" #15 in 1962. The character, also known as Peter Parker, is one of Marvel's most iconic superheroes. 

                Peter Parker, as Spider-Man, gained his powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider during a science experiment. This bite granted him superhuman abilities such as enhanced strength, agility, and the ability to cling to walls. 
                
                What sets Spider-Man apart from many other superheroes is his relatability. Unlike characters like Superman or Thor who are godlike figures, Peter Parker is depicted as a regular person dealing with everyday struggles such as school, work, and relationships while also fighting crime as Spider-Man. This duality creates rich storytelling opportunities, exploring themes of responsibility, sacrifice, and the consequences of one's actions.
                
                Throughout his comic book history, Spider-Man has faced a wide array of villains, including the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Venom, and many others. He's also been a part of various superhero teams like the Avengers and the Fantastic Four.
                
                Spider-Man's popularity extends beyond comics into other media such as animated series, films, and video games. Numerous actors have portrayed the character onscreen, with Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and Tom Holland being notable portrayals in live-action films.</p>
